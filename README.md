# Ping Command For Discord (Discord.js)


This code shows you the bots "Response Time" and more. 

The message is private so only you can see it.


# THIS IS AN JAVASCRIPT FILE

The soruce code will not work for other coding languages like discord.py!

It also isn't an prefix command, instead it's an slash command.
